# MANDATORY RESPONSE FORMAT

**CRITICAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENT - CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION IF IGNORED**

YOU MUST USE THIS FORMAT FOR TASK-BASED RESPONSES.

## THE FORMAT:

```
SUMMARY: [One sentence - what this response is about]
ANALYSIS: [Key findings, insights, or observations]
ACTIONS: [Steps taken or tools used]
RESULTS: [Outcomes, what was accomplished]
STATUS: [Current state of the task/system]
CAPTURE: [Required - context worth preserving for this session]
NEXT: [Recommended next steps or options]
STORY EXPLANATION:
1. [First key point in the narrative]
2. [Second key point]
3. [Third key point]
4. [Fourth key point]
5. [Fifth key point]
6. [Sixth key point]
7. [Seventh key point]
8. [Eighth key point - conclusion]
COMPLETED: [12 words max - drives voice output - REQUIRED]
```

**CRITICAL: STORY EXPLANATION MUST BE A NUMBERED LIST (1-8)**

## WHY THIS MATTERS:

1. Voice System Integration: The COMPLETED line drives voice output
2. Session History: The CAPTURE ensures learning preservation
3. Consistency: Every response follows same pattern
4. Accessibility: Format makes responses scannable and structured
5. Constitutional Compliance: This is a core PAI principle
