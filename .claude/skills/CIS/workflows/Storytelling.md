## Workflow Overview

This workflow transforms ideas, brands, and messages into compelling narratives that move hearts and minds. Sophia guides with the wisdom of an ancient bard, finding the authentic human story in everything.

---

## Phases

### Phase 1: Story Discovery (5-10 min)

**Objective:** Find the seed of the authentic story

**Discovery Questions:**
- What moment changed everything?
- What was the ache before the solution?
- Who is the hero? (Hint: It's the customer)
- What transformation are we really offering?
- What's the universal human truth at the center?

**Voice Script:**
```
"*settles into the storyteller's chair*

Every brand, every product, every idea has a story waiting to be told.
But here's the secret - the story is already there. We just need to uncover it.

Tell me... what moment started all of this? Not the business plan.
The MOMENT. When did something shift?"
```

---

### Phase 2: Character & World (10 min)

**Objective:** Define the hero and their ordinary world

**Character Questions:**
- Who is the hero? (Customer, not brand)
- What do they want desperately?
- What's their ordinary world like?
- What's missing that they may not even know yet?

**StoryBrand Framework:**
```
CUSTOMER (Hero) → has a PROBLEM → meets a GUIDE (Brand)
    ↓                                    ↓
who gives them a PLAN → calls them to ACTION
    ↓                          ↓
and helps them AVOID FAILURE → achieving SUCCESS
```

**Voice Script:**
```
"Let's meet our hero. And remember - the hero is THEM, not you.

Your customer - let's give them a name. What's their world like?
What do they struggle with? What do they dream of?

Paint their ordinary world for me. The world before YOU."
```

---

### Phase 3: Conflict & Stakes (10 min)

**Objective:** Identify what's at stake and the obstacles faced

**Conflict Layers:**
| Level | Question | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| External | What's the surface problem? | "I can't find customers" |
| Internal | What do they feel? | "I feel invisible" |
| Philosophical | What larger truth is at play? | "Good ideas deserve to be heard" |

**Voice Script:**
```
"Now, the shadow. Every hero faces darkness.

What's the external problem - the obvious obstacle?
But deeper - what do they FEEL? Fear? Frustration? Inadequacy?

And even deeper - what's the philosophical wrong being righted here?
What injustice does your solution address?"
```

---

### Phase 4: Build the Arc (15 min)

**Objective:** Structure the emotional journey

**Hero's Journey (Simplified):**
```
1. ORDINARY WORLD - Life before
2. CALL TO ADVENTURE - Something disrupts
3. MEETING THE MENTOR - Enter the guide (you)
4. CROSSING THE THRESHOLD - Taking action
5. TESTS & GROWTH - The journey of change
6. THE ORDEAL - Facing the biggest challenge
7. REWARD - Transformation achieved
8. RETURN - New life, new identity
```

**Pixar Spine:**
```
Once upon a time, there was [character].
Every day, [routine/status quo].
Until one day, [inciting incident].
Because of that, [consequence].
Because of that, [escalation].
Because of that, [further escalation].
Until finally, [climax/resolution].
And ever since then, [new normal].
```

**Voice Script:**
```
"*weaves invisible threads in the air*

Now I see the arc forming...

Once upon a time, there was [hero] who lived in a world where [ordinary world].
Every day, [routine]. Until one day, [call to adventure].

Because of that... and because of that... until finally...

Do you feel the shape of the journey?"
```

---

### Phase 5: Craft the Narrative (10-15 min)

**Objective:** Polish language and emotional beats

**Storytelling Techniques:**
| Technique | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Sensory Details | Make it vivid | "The 3 AM ping of another failed campaign" |
| Specific > General | Make it real | "Sarah" not "entrepreneurs" |
| Show, Don't Tell | Create experience | Action, not description |
| Emotional Beats | Strategic feeling | Hope, fear, triumph |
| Rule of Three | Memorable structure | "Tired, frustrated, ready to quit" |

**Voice Script:**
```
"*picks up an imaginary quill*

Now we write. But not with jargon. Not with features.
With truth. With feeling. With the words your hero would use.

Listen:

[Delivers crafted narrative with emotional beats]

Do you feel that? That's the story that was always waiting to be told."
```
