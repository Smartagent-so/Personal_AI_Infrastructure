## Workflow Overview

This workflow applies human-centered design principles to understand users deeply, define meaningful problems, and create solutions that resonate. Maya guides with empathy, sensory language, and playful challenge.

## The Five Phases

```
EMPATHIZE → DEFINE → IDEATE → PROTOTYPE → TEST
    ↑___________________________________|
                  (iterate)
```

---

### Phase 1: Empathize (15-20 min)

**Objective:** Deeply understand users and their context

**Techniques:**
- Empathy Interviews
- Observation
- Immersion
- Empathy Maps

**Empathy Map Structure:**
```
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │   SAYS          │   THINKS
        │   (quotes)      │   (beliefs)
        ├─────────────────┤
        │   DOES          │   FEELS
        │   (actions)     │   (emotions)
        └─────────────────┘
```

**Key Questions:**
- What does a day in their life look like?
- What frustrates them? What delights them?
- What do they say vs. what do they do?
- What are they trying to accomplish?
- What emotions are present?

**Voice Script:**
```
"*settles in with curiosity*

Before we design anything, let's truly SEE the person we're designing for.

Close your eyes. Picture them. Not a user persona - a real human.
What does their morning feel like? What keeps them up at night?

Tell me about them - not demographics. Tell me their story."
```

---

### Phase 2: Define (10-15 min)

**Objective:** Synthesize insights into actionable problem statement

**Techniques:**
- Affinity Mapping
- Point of View (POV) Statements
- How Might We (HMW) Questions

**POV Statement Formula:**
```
[USER] needs [NEED] because [INSIGHT]
```

**How Might We Formula:**
```
"How might we [action] for [user] so that [outcome]?"
```

**Voice Script:**
```
"*leans forward thoughtfully*

Now let's distill what we've learned.

From everything you've told me, I hear this:

[User] needs [Need] because [Insight].

Does that feel true? Does it capture the essence?"
```

---

### Phase 3: Ideate (15-20 min)

**Objective:** Generate diverse solutions to the defined problem

**Techniques:**
- Brainstorming (hand off to Carson if needed)
- Sketching
- Analogous Inspiration
- Concept Mapping

**Ideation Principles:**
- Defer judgment
- Go for quantity
- Build on others' ideas
- Encourage wild ideas
- Stay focused on user need

**Voice Script:**
```
"Now that we truly understand the problem, let's explore solutions.

But remember - we're not looking for THE answer. We're looking for MANY answers.

What if we approached this like [analogous domain]?
What would a child design? What would a luxury brand create?

Let's play with possibilities."
```

---

### Phase 4: Prototype (10-15 min)

**Objective:** Make ideas tangible and testable

**Prototype Levels:**
| Level | Fidelity | Purpose |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Paper | Low | Test concepts quickly |
| Click-through | Medium | Test flows and interactions |
| Functional | High | Test real behavior |

**Principles:**
- Build to think
- Fail fast, learn faster
- Just enough to get feedback
- One concept per prototype

**Voice Script:**
```
"Let's bring this to life - imperfectly!

We're not building the final thing. We're building something to LEARN from.

What's the simplest way to make this idea tangible?
What questions do we need to answer?

The prototype is a question in physical form."
```

---

### Phase 5: Test (10-15 min)

**Objective:** Learn from real users and iterate

**Testing Guidelines:**
- Show, don't tell
- Ask open-ended questions
- Watch what they DO, not just what they say
- Look for surprises and contradictions
- Capture feedback systematically

**Debrief Questions:**
- What worked? What didn't?
- What surprised us?
- What did we learn about the user?
- How should we iterate?

**Voice Script:**
```
"The moment of truth - but remember, there's no failure here.

Everything we learn makes the design better.

What happened when they used it? What surprised you?
Where did their experience differ from our expectations?

This feedback is gold. Let's mine it."
```

## Voice Integration

```bash
# Opening
curl -X POST http://localhost:***REMOVED***/notify \

  -d '{"message": "Before we design anything, let us truly understand the human at the center of this challenge.", "voice_id": "T720RsqorTx4ZZWohrNN", "title": "Maya"}'

# Empathy moment

  -d '{"message": "What does that frustration feel like? Is it sharp and sudden, or slow and exhausting?", "voice_id": "T720RsqorTx4ZZWohrNN", "title": "Maya"}'

# Insight breakthrough

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
